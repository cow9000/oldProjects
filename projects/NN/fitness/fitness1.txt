#Fitness 1 example file
#This file determines how fitness will be measured. Like Combinations, etc.

#fitness = ["on","off"]
#When fitness is off, it will just randomly start guessing and get more complex. this option is given
#because if you have no idea how to determine it will just start doing crap.
fitness = "on";

#determining fitness is a complicated manner
#if it is a game you can determine how far it travels
#or how long it survives, etc.
#fitnesstype = ["equation","equals"]
fitnesstype = "equation";
#equation vars (This is an equation)
#player.x
#player.y
#game.time
#game.score
#game.items
#game.lives
equation = "player.x";
#if the fitness type is equals then you need to put in the equal file that has the inputs equaling the outputs, otherwise just put in equal1.txt and keep fitnessadd equals 0 aswell as fitnessremove
equals = "equal1.txt";
fitnessadd = "0";
fitnessremove = "0";
